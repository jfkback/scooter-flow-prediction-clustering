# scooter-flow-prediction-clustering

Jupyter notebook used to cluster scooter trajectories and visualize the flow of scooters from one location to another. I used Pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for clustering using DBSCAN. This notebook is not as organized as I would like, but due to time constraints and the experimental nature at my REU, where I wrote this code, I felt prioritizing trying new approaches would be more fruitful.
